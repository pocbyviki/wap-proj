You can bind Eclipse projects to a SonarQube project (supporting SonarQube servers 5.6+). This operation will make SonarLint use the analyzers, quality profiles and settings defined on your SonarQube server. This is a convenient way of customizing the rules used by SonarLint.
First step is to configure connection with the SonarQube server:
In SonarQube server view, right click and choose "New -> Server connection", or directly do "File -> New -> Other... -> SonarLint -> New Server".
Complete connection details (URL and credentials).
When using sonarqube.com set your organization. Leave blank for on premise servers or when using default organization.
Test connection
Click "Finish" to close the wizard. A background process will start updating configuration from the server (may take a while)
